{"name":"Smart Alarm","tagline":"The ultimate home security application for SmartThings.","body":"Smart Alarm is a versatile and highly configurable home security application\r\nfor the [SmartThings](http://fbuy.me/bb9pe) home automation system.\r\n\r\n*Please contribute to the development of this app by making donation via PayPal.*\r\n\r\n[![PayPal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ATTTMV7JV2W9W)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Two arming modes - Away and Stay.\r\n* Unlimited number of security zones (sensors) - contact, motion, moisture\r\nor smoke.\r\n* Each security zone can be designated as Exterior (armed in both Away and\r\nStay modes), Interior (armed in Away mode only), Entrance (same as Exterior,\r\nbut uses entry and exit delays) or Alert (always armed).\r\n* Optional entry and exit delays for the Entrance zones.\r\n* Zone bypass allows quickly exclude selected zones.\r\n* When an alarm is set off, Smart Alarm can turn on sirens and switches as\r\nwell as execute chosen 'Hello, Home' action.\r\n* Smart Alarm can send you push notifications and text messages when it's\r\narmed, disarmed or when an alarm is triggered.\r\n* Voice notifications are available with compatible audio devices, e.g.\r\n[VLC Thing](https://github.com/statusbits/smartthings-vlc)\r\n* Silent mode disables sirens and switches, but leaves push notifications\r\nand text messages on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Arming and Disarming\r\n\r\nSmart Alarm can be armed and disarmed in several different ways:\r\n\r\n1. By assigning home *Modes*. For example, you can configure Smart Alarm to\r\narm in Away mode when the home Mode is set to 'Away', to arm in Stay mode when\r\nthe home Mode is set to 'Night' and disarm when the home Mode is set to 'Home'.\r\nUsing home Mode to arm and disarm Smart Alarm is a very flexible and powerful\r\ntechnique because home modes can be changed by other Smart Apps and 'Hello,\r\nHome' actions. For example, 'Good Night!' action activates the 'Night' mode,\r\nthus automatically arming Smart Alarm in Stay mode.\r\n2. Using a remote control, such as\r\n[Aeon Labs Minimote](http://www.amazon.com/Aeon-Labs-DSA03202-v1-Minimote/dp/B00KU7ERAW)\r\n3. Using REST API endpoints. Smart Alarm provides REST endpoints to allow any\r\nweb client to arm, disarm and trigger panic alarm using HTTP GET request. This\r\nfeature can be used to integrate Smart Alarm into variety of Web dashboards\r\nand remote control web apps.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
